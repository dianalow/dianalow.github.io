title: Fresh start, Blender 2.8 journey
---

Thought I'ld document my [Blender 2.8](https://www.udemy.com/course/blendertutorial/) learning journey to kickstart this new Jekyll-based site. Just finished my first section learning the basics : building a simple scene using primitives, adding materials, making a background and some lighting.

Here you go.
