Not done with Section 3 yet, but mighty pleased with myself here are the results thus far!

Update: Done with Section 3. The first half was all about learning to create a 3D object by using an image as a template to build your outline and then extrude out a shape from your line drawing.

We then moved on to combining several Blender files into a scene (in this case a bowling alley). Also, we created different scenes with the same objects within the same blend file (pretty useful if you want to test different layouts without creating multiple files).

Finally we finished off with learning the different lighting and Eevee rendering options.

Here are my results!

All lined up:
