Done with  Section 2 - learning to work with Edit mode to modify the basic shapes and taking it from there.

Learning about Vertices, Edges and Faces. First up is the keyboard above with keys using position snapping to median from face of base.

Extruding the from a single cube and painting faces.

Making a pyramid: Array modifiers to build steps, loop cuts to segment shapes.
This is my final product of Section 2.

Lots of getting used to functions (and the related shortcuts). Got a new mechanical keyboard, so that's another learning curve with the button layouts.
