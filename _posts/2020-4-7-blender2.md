Done with  Section 2 - learning to work with Edit mode to modify the basic shapes and taking it from there.

Learning about Vertices, Edges and Faces. Here's a keyboard with keys position snapping to median from face of base.

Extruding the from a single cube and painting faces.

Making a pyramid: Array modifiers to build steps, loop cuts to segment shapes.
This is my final product of Section 2.

Lots of getting used to functions (and the related shortcuts). Got a new mechanical keyboard, so that's another learning curve with the button layouts.
