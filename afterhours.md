Sweat is your friend. Virtual is wonderful. Take a chill pill. Drink your coffee.

### Have you tried [Zwift](http://www.zwift.com)?
First attempt at Road to Sky (Alpe du Zwift, emulating the Alpe d'Huez) was during the Tour of Watopia 2020, since I was level 10 and the route wasn't officially open to low level riders like myself unless through special events. A bit over 2 hours, but I was a lazy cow that day.
